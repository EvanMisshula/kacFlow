** 🔢 Simulations and Visuals to Include

*** 1. 2D Kac Walk Trajectories

> *Figure 1 in the paper*

- Simulate paths of the Kac process in 2D with various \((a, c)\) parameters.
- Plot trajectories for increasing damping/velocity pairs:
  \((a, c) = (1, 1), (2, 1), (4, 2), (25, 5)\), and compare to Brownian motion.

Purpose:
☑️ Shows that Kac paths remain structured (not “blurry”)
☑️ Highlights *finite speed*, unlike Brownian motion
