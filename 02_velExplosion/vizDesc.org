*** 2. *Velocity Field Explosion in Diffusion vs. Bounded in Kac*

> Refer to equations (7) and (8) in the paper.

- Plot \(\|v_t\|^2_{L^2(p_t)}\) for score-based diffusion model and Kac.
- Show that in diffusion:

\[
  \|v_t\|^2 \propto \frac{1}{1 - t} \quad \text{(explodes as } t \to 1)
\]  
* But for Kac:

\[
  \|v_t\|^2 \leq d c^2 \quad \text{(bounded)}
\]

*Purpose:*
- Makes the engineering/moral case: bounded velocity = stable &
  trainable
- Underscores Einsteinâ€™s critique of diffusion: unphysical infinite
  speed
