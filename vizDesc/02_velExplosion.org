*** Speaker Notes: Velocity Norm Explosion vs. Bounded Flow
:PROPERTIES:

This section helps learners understand why Kac flows offer a more stable alternative to traditional diffusion models by comparing their velocity field behavior.

We are visualizing not the motion of individual data points, but the flow of probability mass—how a distribution \(\mu_t(x)\) evolves over time.

This evolution is governed by the continuity equation:

\[
\partial_t \mu_t(x) + \nabla \cdot (v_t(x)\, \mu_t(x)) = 0
\]

The velocity field \(v_t(x)\) describes how probability mass moves at each point in space and time.


*** Plot 1: Exploding Diffusion Norm vs. Bounded Kac Norm

Refer to Equation (7) in the paper for the diffusion case:

\[
\|v_t\|^2_{L^2(p_t)} = \mathbb{E}\left[\|\nabla \log p_t(X_t)\|^2\right]
\]

This shows that the score function norm becomes large as \(t \to 1\), especially near sharp data modes. In practice, this leads to exploding gradients and training instability.

Compare that with Equation (8) for the Kac model:

\[
\|v_t\|^2_{L^2(p_t)} \leq d c^2
\]

This is a hard upper bound, and it's independent of how close we are
to the data distribution. This stability is a major advantage of Kac
flows.

In the visualization (`02_1_velFieldNorm.pdf`), we see:

- Red curve: diffusion norm exploding like \(1/(1 - t)\)
- Blue line: Kac norm flat and bounded

Key point: bounded velocity means stable training and numerical robustness.



*** Plot 2: Velocity Field Structure Over Time
:PROPERTIES:
:BEAMER_ENV: note
:END:

In `02_2_velField.pdf`, we visualize the actual velocity fields \(v_t(x)\) for both models at three time points \(t = 0.1, 0.5, 0.9\).

For diffusion:

\[
v_t(x) \approx -\frac{x}{1 - t}
\]

As \(t \to 1\), the slope becomes extremely steep and erratic.

For Kac:

\[
v_t(x) = -a x
\]

This is linear and constant over time—a stable mean-reverting force.

The takeaway here is that Kac velocity fields are simple, interpretable, and consistent. They are well-suited for neural ODE solvers and avoid the stiffness and instability found in score-based diffusion.


*** Summary for Learners
:PROPERTIES:
:BEAMER_ENV: note
:END:

- What flows is probability mass—not data points.
- Diffusion models develop unbounded velocity near data, leading to
  instability.
- Kac flows maintain bounded, structured velocity fields.
- This gives Kac models a strong engineering and physical advantage in
  generative modeling.
