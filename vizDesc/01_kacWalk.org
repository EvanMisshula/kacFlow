The *visualization generated by the 2D Kac walk vs. Brownian motion
code* is critically important in the context of the paper
*"Telegrapher’s Generative Model via Kac Flows"* because it
illustrates the *core motivation and mathematical innovation* of the
paper: replacing *diffusion-based stochastic flows*, which have
infinite-speed, unstructured sample paths, with *Kac flows* that
propagate at finite speed and produce *more physically realistic and
geometrically coherent paths*.

** 🔍 What the Visualization Shows

*** Left Panel: *2D Kac Walk*

- Simulates a particle moving with constant speed \(c\), but randomly
  reversing direction at rate \(a\).
- Paths look *piecewise linear* and *structured*, showing
  *finite-speed propagation*.
- Represents the *Kac process*, which underlies the *telegrapher’s
  equation* (a damped wave equation).

*** Right Panel: *2D Brownian Motion*

- Simulates classical diffusion where particle steps are sampled from
  a normal distribution.
- Paths are *fractal*, *jagged*, and fill space densely — even
  over short time periods.
- Reflects how *diffusion models* allow *unbounded velocity*,
  which is unphysical.

** 🎯 Why This Visualization Matters

*** 1. *Finite vs. Infinite Speed*

- *Brownian motion* allows particles to teleport arbitrarily far in
  small time, violating Einsteinian realism.
- *Kac flow*, in contrast, respects physical limits by ensuring
  velocity remains *bounded by \(c\)*.

*** 2. *Regularity and Stability*

- Kac walks maintain *Lipschitz continuity in Wasserstein space* (see Proposition 11 of the paper), which is vital for:

  - Stable ODE solvers
  - Well-posedness of training
  - Preventing *exploding gradients or velocity fields*

*** 3. *Geometric Clarity for Flow Matching*

- Flow-based models (e.g., via ODEs) depend on accurately estimating
  velocity fields.
- Kac paths provide **clean trajectories** for interpolating between
  distributions — unlike the noisy paths of Brownian motion that make
  regression harder.

*** 4. *Sample Quality & Mode Recovery*

- In toy datasets (e.g. Gaussian mixtures with small σ), Kac flows
  outperform diffusion because they don’t “blur” sharp modes.
- This visualization foreshadows later figures in the paper where
  Kac-based models *recover multiple sharp modes*, while
  diffusion-based models suffer from *mode collapse*.


** 🧪 Educational Value of the Plot

For learners:

- Helps *contrast* stochastic models (diffusion) vs. deterministic yet
  random models (Kac)
- Makes concrete the abstract distinction between:

  - *Score matching* (learns gradient of log density; relies on
    reverse-time SDEs)
  - *Flow matching* (learns a deterministic velocity field)


** 🖼️ Suggested Slide Caption

> *"Side-by-side comparison of Brownian motion and 2D Kac walk shows
how finite-speed, direction-reversing dynamics preserve structure and
avoid velocity explosion. This motivates the telegrapher’s generative
model and underpins its improved sample quality in sharp-mode
distributions."*
