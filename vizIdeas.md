Here are **helpful visualizations and simulations** you can present to give both **intuition** and even a **moral imperative** from *“Telegrapher’s Generative Model via Kac Flows”* by Duong et al. (2025):

---

## 🎯 Key Objectives for Visuals

You want to:

1. **Show how Kac flows differ qualitatively** from diffusion and other models.
2. **Highlight the stability** and **bounded velocity** of Kac flows (vs. exploding gradients).
3. **Justify a physics-informed approach** using intuition from finite-speed propagation.
4. **Expose moral/engineering concerns** with infinite-speed motion (Einstein’s violation).
5. Show **Kac’s success on "hard" problems** — e.g., generating sharp Dirac-like modes.

## 🔢 Simulations and Visuals to Include

### 1. **2D Kac Walk Trajectories**

> *Figure 1 in the paper*

* Simulate paths of the Kac process in 2D with various $(a, c)$ parameters.
* Plot trajectories for increasing damping/velocity pairs:
  $(a, c) = (1, 1), (2, 1), (4, 2), (25, 5)$, and compare to Brownian motion.

**Purpose:**
☑️ Shows that Kac paths remain structured (not “blurry”)
☑️ Highlights *finite speed*, unlike Brownian motion

---

### 2. **Velocity Field Explosion in Diffusion vs. Bounded in Kac**

> Refer to equations (7) and (8) in the paper.

* Plot $\|v_t\|^2_{L^2(p_t)}$ for score-based diffusion model and Kac.
* Show that in diffusion:

  $$
  \|v_t\|^2 \propto \frac{1}{1 - t} \quad \text{(explodes as } t \to 1)
  $$
* But for Kac:

  $$
  \|v_t\|^2 \leq d c^2 \quad \text{(bounded)}
  $$

**Purpose:**
☑️ Makes the engineering/moral case: bounded velocity = stable & trainable
☑️ Underscores Einstein’s critique of diffusion: unphysical infinite speed

---

### 3. **Comparison of Sample Quality**

> *Figure 5 from the paper: toy 2D Gaussians with sharp modes*

* Dataset: 9 Gaussian blobs on a 3×3 grid with tiny variance ($\sigma = 0.0001$)
* Show side-by-side generation from:

  * Kac model ($a, c$ = increasing)
  * Diffusion model
* Highlight that Kac recovers **all modes sharply**, while diffusion blurs them.

**Purpose:**
☑️ Empirically shows that Kac avoids **mode collapse**
☑️ Demonstrates that diffusion **fails for sharply peaked distributions**

---

### 4. **MNIST Generations Over Time and Parameters**

> *Figures 6–8 from the paper*

* Vary $(a, c)$ and final time $T$:

  * E.g., $(1,1)$, $(25,5)$, $(225,15)$, $T = 1, 5$
* Show:

  * Forward evolution (how MNIST diffuses)
  * Backward evolution (how samples are generated)

**Purpose:**
☑️ Illustrates how *mean-reverting Kac flows* improve realism
☑️ Shows importance of parameter choice and supports design recommendations

---

### 5. **Moral Analogy Slide:**

> Finite-speed Kac flow vs. infinite-speed Brownian motion

* Frame with analogy to relativity:
  “Diffusion allows mass to travel instantaneously. Einstein would object.”
* Show visual:

  * A diffusion "jump" from center to far out
  * A Kac process “walking” with speed limit

**Purpose:**
☑️ Helps audience understand **why** unbounded velocities are problematic
☑️ Gives physical and ethical resonance to Kac’s constraint

---

## 🧠 Bonus for Deeper Learners

**Plot or animate:**
The conditional velocity field $v(t, x \mid x_0)$ from Corollary 15 (eq. 39).

* Simulate or color vector fields showing where the flow moves data.
* Optionally overlay with samples from $\mu_t$

## 🔚 Conclusion Slide Suggestion

> “Kac Flows respect geometry, physics, and probability — all while improving generation.”
